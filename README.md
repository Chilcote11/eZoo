## Application Description: 

Welcome to the eZoo application!  A JavaEE MVC application designed to manage a virtual zoo’s animals and events with an easy-to-use user interface for employees and customers

Revature, a company committed to training entry-level software developers, provided the original template for this project (now making up around 10% of the overall application).  That template included some basic package structure, along with the heavy lifting for the front-end graphics.  My task has been to create the database tables, relate them together, access them from Eclipse, and add functionality to display and manipulate that data through POCOs and Servlets (now Controllers) on JavaServer Pages that I would create.  A few instructional videos and several hundred Google searches later, the first version of this application was birthed (see `branch: eZoo100`).  From there the application has been, and is still in the process of being, upgraded to utilize the tools and frameworks listed below.

Though unlikely to ever benefit a real zoo, this project has served me well as a thorough introduction to Java development.


## Tools and Frameworks Used

Developed using Eclipse, Maven, PostgreSQL, HTML & CSS (bootstrap, mostly) JSPs, and JDBC for data access objects

Recently upgraded to use Spring and Hibernate instead of JDBC, greatly simplifying the data access layer

Currently implementing Spring Framework’s MVC and security features, Log4J for logging, and JavaScript to improve JSPs


## Deployment Instructions

To run this application, you'll need Java8 or later, Eclipse, Wildly server, and PostgreSQL.
- Instructions for installing these technologies can be found in SETUP.docx
- Once installed, CONFIG.docx can be used to link these technologies together	

You'll also need Maven 3 if running anything after version 1 (branch: eZoo100)
- Be aware that version 2 is still in development, so some functionality may not yet be implemented
			

### Maven 3 installation
	
**Linux Installation with `apt`**
- sudo apt install maven

**Windows Installation**
- Download the binary zip archive from [the apache maven site](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
- Extract files to some known location, could be C:\Program Files\Maven\
- Add `C:\Program Files\Maven\apache-maven-3.*.*\bin` to the system `PATH` variable
- mvn --version in a new terminal window should now show the Maven 3 version installed as well as the Java version it recognizes
